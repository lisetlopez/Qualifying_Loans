# Qualifying_Loans

In this module, a user story was created to save a list of qualifying loans to a CSV file to share the results as a spreadsheet.

A new save_csv function was integrated into the existing loan qualifier application.

In app.py, a new function named save_qualifying_loans that accepts the list of qualifying loans was created.

Inside the new save_qualifying_loans function, a user dialog that prompts the user for whether they want to save their qualifying loans was created. Questionary was used to prompt the user.

Once the app.py is running in the terminal, it will prompt you to input your results. After inputting your information, a CSV file with your qualifying loans will save. Below is an example of how a terminal run would go.
